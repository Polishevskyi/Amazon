# Automated Web Testing with Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenide, WebDriverManager, Allure, and Jenkins

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our automated web testing project. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive, scalable solution for automating web application testing. We utilize a stack of powerful technologies to streamline the testing process, including Java, Maven, TestNG, Selenide, WebDriverManager, Allure, and Jenkins.

## Key Features

- **Java:** The primary programming language for creating robust and scalable test scripts.
- **Maven:** The build and project management tool to simplify dependency management and test execution.
- **TestNG:** A versatile testing framework for easily structuring and running test cases.
- **Selenide:** A concise and expressive UI testing framework built on Selenium, simplifying web testing.
- **WebDriverManager:** An easy-to-use tool for managing web driver setup and configurations.
- **Allure:** A powerful reporting tool for generating detailed and visually appealing test reports.
- **Jenkins:** Integration with Jenkins for continuous integration and automated test execution.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- TestNG
- Selenide
- WebDriverManager
- Allure
- Jenkins (if you plan to set up continuous integration)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure your test environment and URLs in the appropriate configuration files.
3. Run the tests using Maven: mvn clean test
4. Generate Allure reports: allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
5. View the detailed test reports in the `allure-report` directory.

## Usage
