# Automated Testing with: 
# Java, TestNG, Selenide, WebDriverManager, Allure, and Jenkins

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our automated testing project! This project will help you quickly set up automated tests for web applications using Java, TestNG, Selenide, WebDriverManager, Allure, and Jenkins. These technologies combine to provide a robust and scalable solution for automating your web testing processes.

## Key Features

- **Java:** The primary programming language for writing your test scripts.
- **Maven:** Dependency management and build automation tool.
- **TestNG:** A powerful testing framework for running and organizing test cases.
- **Selenide:** A concise and expressive UI testing framework built on top of Selenium.
- **WebDriverManager:** Simplifies web driver setup and management.
- **Allure:** Generates detailed and visually appealing test reports for better analysis.
- **Jenkins:** Integrates with Jenkins for continuous integration and automated test execution.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- TestNG
